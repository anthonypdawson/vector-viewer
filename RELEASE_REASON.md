# Latest updates

- Added optional telemetry opt-in in settings panel (File -> Preferences -> Telemetry). See docs/telemetry/model_telemetry_and_registry.md and docs/telemetry/unified_telemetry_architecture.md for details.
  - Currently only 'launch' telemetry is sent. Model registry telemetry will be added later.
